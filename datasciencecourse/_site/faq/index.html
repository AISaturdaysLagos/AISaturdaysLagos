      <p><strong>Q: What is the situation will all the different course numbers and sections (15-388, 15-688 A/B)?</strong></p>

<p>A:  To accommodate as many as people as possible, we created a section DNM (Does Not Meet) section of the 600 level course, which is the B section of the 15-688 course. This version is identical to the A section, except that students are expected to watch the lectures online (all lectures will be available online within a few hours after the end of class).</p>

<p><strong>Q: How can I switch between 15-688 and 15-388, or between section A and B?</strong></p>

<p>A: Please fill out a copy of the <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/hub/docs/late-add.pdf">CMU Course Late Add Form</a>, and email it to <a href="mailto:zkolter@cs.cmu.edu">the course instructor</a> or bring it to a lecture to get his signature.  (You’ll need to get other signatures to complete and submit the form.)</p>

<p><strong>Q: I am a masters student and I really want to switch to 15-688 Section A. Will I be able to get off the waitlist?</strong></p>

<p>(See the previous question for how to make the switch.)</p>

<p>We want to accommodate as many people as possible, but are ultimately limited by the classroom size and university policy (undergraduates have priority for in-class lectures).</p>

<p>We really want to emphasize that the courses are otherwise exactly the same: same credit, same homework, same office hours, same access to TAs/professor, same tutorial and final project assignments, etc. Section B students can usually attend lectures by the end of the add-drop period.</p>

<p><strong>Q: I’m on the waitlist for the 15-388 version. Will I be able to get off the waitlist?</strong></p>

<p>Almost definitely. There is a relatively small waitlist and we expect all students who stick around a few weeks to a place in the class.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Can I take the course pass/fail?</strong></p>

<p>A: Yes.  You will ultimately need to receive a grade of “C” or higher (according to the final curve), to receiving a pass.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Can I audit the course?</strong></p>

<p>A: Yes, but you must receive a grade of at least 50% of the total points in at least 4 of the 5 homework assignments.  Audits for the undergrad version will only be offered if space allows (since we cannot offer a B section for 388).  Auditors can optionally submit a tutorial or project or attend class, but these will not count towards your grade.  For the final project, you cannot work with students who are taking the course for credit.</p>

<p>To audit the course, complete <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/hub/docs/course-audit.pdf">this form</a> and bring it to a lecture for Prof. Kolter to sign. If you are not in the Pittsburgh campus, fill in your section, scan, and email it to <a href="mailto:zkolter@cs.cmu.edu"><code class="highlighter-rouge">zkolter@cs.cmu.edu</code></a>.</p>

<p><strong>Q: When will this course be offered again?</strong></p>

<p>A: Most likely in Fall 2020, but this is not yet finalized.  It will definitely not be offered Spring 2020.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Will this course focus mainly on applying techniques from existing libraries to practical data science problems, or writing the underlying algorithms from scratch?</strong></p>

<p>A: Both, to a certain extent. There will be plenty of focus on applying algorithms (often best used through existing libraries) to practical problems, but these libraries can be used more effectively when you understand the underlying algorithms well enough to implement them yourself. So, at least for the more straightforward algorithms that we cover, you will be implementing these yourselves. The 688 level course assignment will do a bit more of this underlying implementation than the 388 level course.</p>

<p><strong>Q: What is the difference between this course at 10-401/10-601/10-701/15-381/etc?</strong></p>

<p>There is naturally some overlap between this course and various machine learning or AI courses taught at CMU.  There are also several courses taught outside of SCS (in Stats, Heinz, etc) that have similar topics.  The short answer to this question is that the focus of this course (e.g., in the assignments) is more on programming and analyzing data, and much less on the math than in most courses we’re aware of.  However, the best way to get a sense of the differences is to simply compare the lectures and assignments.</p>

<p><strong>Q: I have a question that wasn’t asked here.</strong></p>

<p>A: Come to office hours, or ask on the course Diderot.</p>
