title: Homework 2
---

Homework 2 is released in three parts. To complete Homework 2, you must submit **all** parts. Here are the handouts:

- [Time Series]({{ baseurl }}/assignments/hw2_time_series.handout.tgz) (80 points)
- [Relational Data]({{ baseurl }}/assignments/hw2_relational_data.handout.tgz) (90 points)
- [Graph Library]({{ baseurl }}/assignments/hw2_graph_library.handout.tgz) (100 points) - Only for students in the **15-688** version of the course.

Each part is a separate code lab in Diderot. You can (and should) submit each part as you complete it.

## Recitation

We will hold a recitation (see [schedule]({{ baseurl }}/lectures/)) for this homework in which we will review some basic concepts for this homework. If you have previous experience with `numpy`, `pandas` and/or `sqlite`, the recitation is unlikely to teach you anything new. Attempt all parts of the homework before attending the recitation to make the most of it.

Recitation notes are [here]({{ baseurl }}/notes/recitation_2/).

## Notes/Hints

- Time Series
  - If you get a `FutureWarning` when running the import function, this is safe to ignore.
  - All solutions are only a few lines long and make extensive use of Pandas features. You should not be looping over data.
- Graph Library
  - The matrix math is the most common stumbling block. Review the lecture notes and slides.
