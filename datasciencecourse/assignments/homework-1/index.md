title: Homework 1
---

Homework 1 is released in three parts. To complete Homework 1, you must submit **all** three separate parts. Here are the handouts:

- [Get Started]({{ baseurl }}/assignments/hw1_get_started.handout.tgz) (10 points)
- [Scraper]({{ baseurl }}/assignments/hw1_scraper.handout.tgz) (80 points)
- [XML Parser]({{ baseurl }}/assignments/hw1_xml_parser.handout.tgz) (90 points) - Only for students in the **15-688** version of the course.

Each part is a separate code lab in Diderot. You can (and should) submit each part as you complete it.

## Recitation

We will hold a recitation (see [schedule]({{ baseurl }}/lectures/)) for this homework in which we will go over some of the basic concepts for this homework. If you have previous experience with programming, the recitation is unlikely to teach you anything new. Attempt all parts of the homework before attending the recitation to make the most of it.

Recitation notes are available [here]({{ baseurl }}/notes/recitation_1/).
