Homework 4 is released in three parts. To complete it, you must submit **all** parts. Here are the handouts:

- [Support Vector Machine]({{ baseurl }}/assignments/hw4_svm.handout.tgz) (80 points)
- [Naive Bayes]({{ baseurl }}/assignments/hw4_bayes.handout.tgz) (90 points)
- [Collaborative Filtering]({{ baseurl }}/assignments/hw4_cf.handout.tgz) (80 points) - Only for students in the **15-688** version of the course.

Each part is a separate code lab in Diderot. You can (and should) submit each part as you complete it.

## Recitation

We will hold a recitation (see [schedule]({{ baseurl }}/lectures/)) for this homework in which we will review some basic concepts for this homework. Attempt all parts of the homework before attending the recitation to make the most of it.

The recitation notes are available [here]({{ baseurl }}/notes/recitation_4/).
